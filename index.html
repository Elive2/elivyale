TODO:
(in no particular order)

[x] - write a small svg concatenator and load svgs from that
	- try all different export combos from illustrator
	- try not using spritebot
	- alternatives to <use>, viewboxing, or object, or just plain image
	- try in a test file like locate.html, incase it is a z-index issue
	*Lessons: SVG Gradients, wether internal css, inline css or whatever
	do not render when the svg is <used> in another document. This is a 
	chrome bug. You should be able to define the gradients in your html, 
	then reference them in the <use>ed svg But this is tricky and not 
	worth the hassle. If the SVG is small enough, like the cliffs and
	shelves, just inline them to save requests. If the SVG is larger like 
	the trees, just request it and load however you like. Defeat boco
	literally loads all svg independently with no speed issues, well a little
	there is a loading animation at the start.
[x] - fix cliffs
[x] - smoother/slower mountains in the beggining
