# Eli Yale Coding Sample

This File contains a few Javasript classes I implemented recently
for animation on my personal website. ParallaxAnimator allow you
to animate an html container with a parallax effect based on the 
scroll position. It uses CSS 3d transforms to perform the movement.
Typewriter.js is a animation to mimick the typewriter effect for an
html canvas element. You can pass it the words you want to type and
the speeds. I am revamping my personal portfolio website as I am
applying to jobs and will publish the final site soon.
